## 🌟 **What’s Inside?**  

### 1. **Faulty Calculator** 🤔  
- **Description**:  
  This isn’t your average calculator—it’s a *prankster*! Designed to throw off unsuspecting users, it delivers "special" outputs for a few chosen operations while working fine for the rest.  

- **How it Works**:  
  - Enter `45 * 3` → It cheekily outputs **555**!  
  - Try `56 + 9` → "cheating karoge" (a surprise twist instead of the correct answer).  
  - For `56 / 6`, it mischievously displays **4**.  
  - All other operations? They behave like an obedient calculator.  

- **Why It’s Cool**:  
  - It’s not just functional—it’s entertaining.  
  - A great exercise in conditional logic and user interaction.

### 2. **Jarvis (Basic AI Assistant)** 🤖  
- **Description**:  
  Imagine a mini Iron Man assistant on your computer! This AI-powered companion uses OpenAI to answer your questions and even perform small tasks like opening websites—all through your voice commands.  

- **How it Works**:  
  - **Talk to Jarvis**: Speak naturally, and it listens, understands, and responds.  
  - **Superpowers**: Open YouTube, Google, and other cool sites at your command.  
  - Powered by **speech recognition**, **text-to-speech**, and **OpenAI’s GPT API**, it’s your personal tech sidekick!  

- **Why It’s Cool**:  
  - A blend of voice interaction and AI smarts.  
  - The perfect entry into the world of AI and automation.

### 3. **Message Encryption and Decryption** 🕵️‍♂️  
- **Description**:  
  Secret agent vibes, anyone? 🕶️ This project turns your messages into a coded language and can decode them too. Your secrets are safe with me!  

- **How it Works**:  
  - **Encryption**:  
    - If your word has 3+ characters:  
      1. The first letter sneaks to the end.  
      2. Random characters are added to cloak it further.  
    - For shorter words, it just flips the string.  
  - **Decryption**:  
    - Reverse the process to reveal the original message!  

- **Why It’s Cool**:  
  - Simple yet powerful introduction to cryptography concepts.  
  - Feel like a spy while coding and decoding your messages.

## 💻 **Tech Stack**  
- **Python**: The star of the show.  
- Libraries used:  
  - `pyttsx3` for converting text to speech.  
  - `speech_recognition` for listening to your voice.  
  - `openai` for AI-based responses (powered by GPT).
